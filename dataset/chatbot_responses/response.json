Then, unscrew the water supply hose and carefully remove the seal and the plastic filter using pliers or scissor grips. Make sure to refit everything in reverse order, tightening by hand and ensuring all parts are free of dirt or grit.\n"

So, to clean your dishwasher, you should place a bowl with white vinegar (about 3/4 - 1 1/4 cups, or 200-300 mL) on the upper rack, then run an Auto cycle without detergent. When it's done, restart the cycle. Just be careful not to pour the vinegar directly into the base, and don't do it too often as it might cause damage. Is there anything else?\n"

Also, if there are any blockages check the filters, and spray arms. Remember to check the water supply hose as well. Let me know if you have more questions.\n"
