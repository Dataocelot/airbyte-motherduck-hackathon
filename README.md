# Data-Driven Customer Support: Transforming the Customer supoport experience at 'Appliance Ocelot'

Appliance Ocelot is a brand that sells top home electronics to customers both online and in-store.

Recently, we discovered that a significant portion of customer support time is spent addressing repetitive queries that are already explained in the user manuals of our products. This not only overwhelms our Customer support team but also delays resolutions for more complex issues, impacting customer satisfaction.

In this hackathon, we aim to address this challenge by leveraging data and AI to create a scalable solution. Our mission is to enhance customer support efficiency while empowering customers to independently troubleshoot and resolve common issues.

## The Solution: `Anuja`

We developed Anuja, a data-driven customer support chatbot designed to assist customers in resolving issues quickly and independently. By parsing product user manuals into actionable data, Anuja provides instant and accurate troubleshooting solutions. This allows our support team to focus on high-priority issues, improving overall service quality and customer experience.
